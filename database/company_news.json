Most publicly available information is limited to company overviews and store counts, without mention of digital or visual strategies.\n\nKey findings:\n\n• A company profile indicates Boston FAM operates ~15 stores across Wisconsin and is employee‑owned, with revenues estimated between $40M–$200M and 500–1,000 employees ([leadiq.com](https://leadiq.com/c/boston-fam--dba-furniture--appliancemart-and-ashley/5a1d982c230000520086d15f?utm_source=openai)).  \n• No news articles or press releases were found regarding e‑commerce growth, website redesigns, catalog expansions, digital transformation, or technology investments.  \n• The company’s website and brand pages (e.g., Ashley collections) show product listings but no announcements of new digital initiatives ([furnitureappliancemart.com](https://www.furnitureappliancemart.com/brand/ashley-furniture/1128005469?utm_source=openai)).\n\nGiven the absence of relevant news, I cannot provide the 15–20 required news items. It appears that Boston FAM has not publicly communicated any digital or visual content initiatives in the past two years.\n\nWould you like me to broaden the scope to include Ashley Furniture corporate-level news (not specific to Boston FAM), or perhaps analyze competitor activity to infer potential opportunities?",
